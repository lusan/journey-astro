I am a web developer with nearly a decade of experience in creating high-performance web applications. My current role involves leading both the technology and business aspects of the merchant web front for PhonePe, blending technical expertise with strategic business acumen to drive growth and performance enhancements. Before joining PhonePe, I was a UI Engineer 3 at Flipkart in the web core team, focusing on improving website performance and architecture. My career before Flipkart was marked by valuable experiences in startups, where I honed my skills in a dynamic and innovative environment, tackling a wide range of technical challenges and learning to adapt quickly to the ever-changing tech landscape. This journey has instilled in me a deep passion for solving complex problems and enhancing the efficiency and user-friendliness of web applications.
